# About

Given a range of numbers, loop through each number and output the following:
- If the number is divisible by 3 then output the word Fizz instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by 5 then output the word Buzz instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then output the word Fizzbuzz instead of the
number.
- If none of the above conditions are met then output the number.

For the purpose of this test you should use a range of 1 to 100. Output of the results should be to a
console window.
